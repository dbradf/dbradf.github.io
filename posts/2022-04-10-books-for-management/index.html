      <h1>Books for Management</h1>
      <p><img src="/images/manager_books.jpg" alt="Management Books"></p>
<p>After being a manager for a few years, I&rsquo;ve done well enough to have a few of the engineers I&rsquo;ve
managed become managers themselves. While I am moving back to an individual contributor role, I
have spent a lot of time geeking out about management and it seems I have accumulated a good bit
of knowledge.</p>
<p>This post is meant to document some of the books I found useful learning to manage.</p>
<h2 id="tech-management">Tech Management</h2>
<p>Books on managing in the tech world.</p>
<h3 id="the-managers-path">The Managers Path</h3>
<p>This <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Managers-Path-Leaders-Navigating-Growth/dp/1491973897">book</a> is a
great overview of being a manager in the tech industry. It has chapters that go
through all the different levels of management, from mentoring all the way to CTO. It has a lot
of great insights and since it is specific to tech management, it covers a lot of areas that
more general management books miss.</p>
<h3 id="an-elegant-puzzle">An Elegant Puzzle</h3>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I would recommend this <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elegant-Puzzle-Systems-Engineering-Management/dp/1732265186">book</a>
as someone&rsquo;s first book on management. But once you have ramped up on the basics on management,
this book provides a lot of important concepts (e.g. how to organize teams, how to come up with
policy, how to create a culture, etc). It also has a lot of good references for learning more.</p>
<h3 id="staff-engineer">Staff Engineer</h3>
<p>This <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Staff-Engineer-Leadership-beyond-management/dp/1736417916">book</a> I&rsquo;m
listing for selfish reasons. As I move into a Staff Engineer role, I want managers to understand
what that role looks like and understand what to expect from me.</p>
<h2 id="leading-tech-teams">Leading Tech Teams</h2>
<h3 id="essential-scrum">Essential Scrum</h3>
<p>Lots of technical teams nowadays are using Scrum to manage their work. And lots of technical
teams are using scrum poorly. In my experience, there is a lot of using scrum words and going
through some of the motions, but not really doing scrum. This
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Essential-Scrum-Practical-Addison-Wesley-Signature/dp/0137043295">book</a>
does a good job of describing the actual scrum process and discussing the different parts of
it and their value.</p>
<h3 id="the-lean-startup">The Lean Startup</h3>
<p>This <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lean-Startup-Entrepreneurs-Continuous-Innovation/dp/0670921602">book</a>
is all about using an iterative development model and using feedback to make adjustments to what
you are building in order to actually build something useful. It is targeted at startups, but
has useful info that is valuable to all technical organizations.</p>
<h3 id="the-phoenix-project">The Phoenix Project</h3>
<p>This <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Phoenix-Project-DevOps-Helping-Business/dp/1942788290">book</a> is
basically a narrative introduction to DevOps. While I don&rsquo;t really like the narrative style for
management books, it does a good job of communicating the key ideas of DevOps, which I think are
really valuable for Software Development in General.</p>
<h3 id="the-devops-handbook">The DevOps Handbook</h3>
<p>This <a href="https://www.amazon.com/DevOps-Handbook-World-Class-Reliability-Organizations/dp/1950508404">book</a>
is similar to &ldquo;The Phoenix Project&rdquo;, but it is not written as a narrative. So, I like it more, but
it does take a bit longer to get through (and has more detailed information).</p>
<h3 id="accelerate">Accelerate</h3>
<p>This <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Accelerate-Software-Performing-Technology-Organizations/dp/1942788339">book</a>
talks through some of the recent finding in DevOps. What I really like about this book is that they
talk about how they did they research and came to their conclusion.</p>
<h2 id="general-management">General Management</h2>
<p>More general management books.</p>
<h3 id="drive">Drive</h3>
<p>This <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Drive-Surprising-Truth-About-Motivates/dp/1786891700">book</a> is
about motivation. In particular the motivational differences between average performers and
high-performers. It lists autonomy, master, and purpose as the three big factors behind
high-performance motivation.</p>
<h3 id="good-strategy--bad-strategy">Good Strategy / Bad Strategy</h3>
<p>This was a recommendation from “An Elegant Puzzle” and it is a great
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Good-Strategy-Bad-difference-matters/dp/1781256179">book</a> on
strategy. It does a really good job of describing what strategy is and how to develop good
strategies. It also provides a good list of common mistakes of poor strategies.</p>
<h3 id="deep-work">Deep Work</h3>
<p>As a manager, I felt like I spent a good bit of effort trying to protect my team from interruptions
and unnecessary meetings. This <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/1455586692">book</a>
describes why. It talks about the need for long periods of uninterrupted focused work in order to
solve more complex challenges.</p>
<h3 id="the-five-dysfunctions-of-a-team">The Five Dysfunctions of a Team</h3>
<p>This <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Five-Dysfunctions-Team-Leadership-Fable/dp/0787960756">book</a> was given
to all the managers at the first company I managed at. It provides 5 key components that teams need
in order to be successful. This is another narrative style books, which I tend not to like, but
there is some good information here.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This is far from a complete list and I&rsquo;ll likely add more books to it in the future. But each of
these books has provided some value to me in learning to manage and lead technical teams.</p>
